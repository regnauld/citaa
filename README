citaa is a small command-line utility written in C, that can convert
diagrams drawn using ascii art ('drawings' that contain characters that
resemble lines like | / - ), into proper graphical file.

citaa largely implements functionality provided by a Java utility ditaa
(http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/), with some minor differences.

The citaa source code and algorithms are not related to ditaa source
code and algorithms in any intentional way.
